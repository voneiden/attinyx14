The ATtiny boots up with the 16/20 MHz oscillator (OSC20M) running at 20 MHz as the clock source and a prescaler division factor of 6 giving a frequency of at 3.333 MHz <REF:74>.

The clock source can be configured by temporarily disabling I/O register Configuration Change Protection (CCP) by setting 0xD8 as the value of <REG:CPU.CCP> register, followed by setting the desired value to <REG:CLKCTRL.MCLKCTRLA.CLKSEL> register.

OSC20M frequency is defined by frequency select bits (FREQSEL, default 0x0 = 20 MHz) of the oscillator configurator fuse (FUSE.OSCCFG <REF:30>).
